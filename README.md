Hi

This program is made to tell you whether your car will travel a certain number of kilometers. 

There will be a few simple steps inside the program. You need to provide 6 information.

1. Car brand.
2. Model.
3. Capacity of the engine.
4. Consumption of the fuel.
5. Fuel in the tank.
6. Distance to go.

There are 2 solutions of the program.
Either the program will immediately tell you whether your vehicle will drive a given number of kilometers and how many liters of fuel it will have left in the tank
or it will deliver you a message that your vehicle will not drive a given number of kilometers and it will show you how much fuel it will need.

Enjoy :)
